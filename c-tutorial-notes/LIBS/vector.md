## std::vector

Except for the¬†[`std::vector<bool>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector_bool.html "cpp/container/vector bool")¬†partial specialization, the elements are stored contiguously, which means that elements can be accessed not only through iterators, but also using offsets to regular pointers to elements. This means that a pointer to an element of a vector may be passed to any function that expects a pointer to an element of an array.

The storage of the vector is handled automatically, being expanded as needed. Vectors usually occupy more space than static arrays, because more memory is allocated to handle future growth. This way a vector does not need to reallocate each time an element is inserted, but only when the additional memory is exhausted. The total amount of allocated memory can be queried using¬†[capacity()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/capacity.html "cpp/container/vector/capacity")¬†function. Extra memory can be returned to the system via a call to¬†[shrink_to_fit()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/shrink_to_fit.html "cpp/container/vector/shrink to fit")[[1]](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector.html#cite_note-1).

Reallocations are usually costly operations in terms of performance. The¬†[reserve()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/reserve.html "cpp/container/vector/reserve")¬†function can be used to eliminate reallocations if the number of elements is known beforehand.

The complexity (efficiency) of common operations on vectors is as follows:

- Random access - constant¬†ùìû(1).
- Insertion or removal of elements at the end - amortized constant¬†ùìû(1).
- Insertion or removal of elements - linear in the distance to the end of the vector¬†ùìû(n).

## use of iterators for vectors

Normally with arrays, we only need a pointer to the first element to traverse the entire array. However, vectors don't have a fixed size. As we keep pushing new items, the capacity needs to increase. At some point, if it's no longer possible to maintain contiguous memory because the current memory chunk is full, we need to find another free chunk of contiguous memory and relocate all the data to that location.

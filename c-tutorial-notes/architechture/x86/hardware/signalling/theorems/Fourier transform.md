In mathematics, the Fourier transform (FT) is an integral transform that takes a function as input then outputs another function that describes the extent to which various frequencies are present in the original function.

## Fourier Transform

The Fourier transform is a transformation technique which is used to transform the signals from continuous-time domain to the corresponding frequency domain.

Mathematically, if x(t)x(t) is a continuous-time domain function, then its Fourier transform is given by,

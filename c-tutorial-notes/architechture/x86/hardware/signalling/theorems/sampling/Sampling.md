![Signal sampling representation. The continuous signal _S_(_t_) is represented with a green colored line while the discrete samples are indicated by the blue vertical lines.](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250628142500.png)

In signal processing, sampling is the reduction of a continuous-time signal to a discrete-time signal. A common example is the conversion of a sound wave to a sequence of "samples". A sample is a value of the signal at a point in time and/or space; this definition differs from the term's usage in statistics, which refers to a set of such values.

A sampler is a subsystem or operation that extracts samples from a continuous signal. A theoretical ideal sampler produces samples equivalent to the instantaneous value of the continuous signal at the desired points.

Functions of space, time, or any other dimension can be sampled, and similarly in two or more dimensions.

For functions that vary with time, let s(t)![{\displaystyle s(t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c484de351ba40ccb9a5ad522c29c1aac5686c0df) be a continuous function (or "signal") to be sampled, and let sampling be performed by measuring the value of the continuous function every T![{\displaystyle T}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec7200acd984a1d3a3d7dc455e262fbe54f7f6e0) seconds, which is called the **sampling interval** or **sampling period**.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_\(signal_processing\)#cite_note-2)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_\(signal_processing\)#cite_note-Moir-3) Then the sampled function is given by the sequence:

s(nT)![{\displaystyle s(nT)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/88618d85a88d84d826a8b0d09b81010beb5559ff), for integer values of n![{\displaystyle n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b).

The **sampling frequency** or **sampling rate**, fs![{\displaystyle f_{s}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/34f933ad7a8dc310b3fa8e9f7b0b2558cba136db), is the average number of samples obtained in one second, thus fs=1/T![{\displaystyle f_{s}=1/T}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/004344797e3e0aabccd69becff32ef5c31063cc5), with the unit _samples per second_, sometimes referred to as [hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz "Hertz"), for example 48 kHz is 48,000 _samples per second_.

Reconstructing a continuous function from samples is done by interpolation algorithms. The [Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whittaker%E2%80%93Shannon_interpolation_formula "Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula") is mathematically equivalent to an ideal [low-pass filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter "Low-pass filter") whose input is a sequence of [Dirac delta functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_functions "Dirac delta functions") that are modulated (multiplied) by the sample values. When the time interval between adjacent samples is a constant (T)![{\displaystyle (T)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c5f9a82bdcb95d511ed6965b0534a3eda98ceb62), the sequence of delta functions is called a [Dirac comb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_comb "Dirac comb"). Mathematically, the modulated Dirac comb is equivalent to the product of the comb function with s(t)![{\displaystyle s(t)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c484de351ba40ccb9a5ad522c29c1aac5686c0df). That mathematical abstraction is sometimes referred to as _impulse sampling_.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_\(signal_processing\)#cite_note-4)

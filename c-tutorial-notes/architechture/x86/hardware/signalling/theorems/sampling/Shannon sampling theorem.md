Shannon’s Sampling theorem states that a digital waveform must be updated at least twice as fast as the bandwidth of the signal to be accurately generated. The same image that was used for the [Nyquist sampling theorem](Nyquist%20sampling%20theorem.md) can be used to demonstrate Shannon’s Sampling theorem. The following figure shows a desired 5 MHz sine wave generated by a 6 MS/s DAC. The dotted line represents the desired waveform, and the arrows represent the digitized samples that are available to recreate the continuous time 5 MHz sine wave. The solid line indicates the signal that would be seen, for example, with an oscilloscope at the output of a DAC.

In this case, the high–frequency sine wave is the desired signal, but was severely undersampled by only being generated by a 6 MS/s DAC; the actual resulting waveform is a 1 MHz signal.

In systems where you want to generate accurate signals using sampled data, you must set the sampling rate high enough to prevent aliasing.

- This is  a very basic representation of how data is transferred from external devices. We have a micro-controller unit that has a cache. We might have one or many of these depending on the requirement.
- This cache's certain part is linked to the buffer which is read by another MCU (this MCU specially helps in things like encryption-decryption, adapter and frequency ),  can also be replaced by a hardwired logic or even just be a part of the original bigger MCU.
- The data is then transferred to the cpu motherboard using the required protocol.
- again we need to have another mcu/hardware-logic to understand the protocol part and then finally save the required data in a small buffer assigned to the device within the RAM
- later the application running on the X86 core and read this buffer ad do the required changes
